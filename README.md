##Coffeescript + Backbone + Require Boilerplate##

Simple structure and starter templates


Watching coffeescript files:
------------------

Just run `coffee -o js/ -cw coffee/` from the project root to automatically watch your coffeescript files and copy them into the `js` folder.

Building documentation with groc:
------------------

Configure `.groc.json` to your liking (note that you need to handle nested folders yourself) and run `groc` from the command line to build.

README.md goes to index.html, everything else is linked from there.
