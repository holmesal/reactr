Redesign.
Build a controller in seconds, and send realtime data to any internet-connected device.
Your controller lives on the web.
White background, photo vertical or horizontal on the left/top with the logo, blur, etc.
Get hacking.
Pick a URL.
The text over nothing doesn't work so well - a cleaner design would be much better. However, a lot of the elements are currently there. The tabs are a good breakup of information.
What about the constraint that the whole thing has to be buildable from a mobile device? How does that change the workflow?
I should be seeing my controller all of the time. I should be able to rearrange controls by dragging, edit them by clicking a button, and remove them by clicking another button.
There should be a persistent button (maybe at the top of the controls screen) that allows me to add controls. 

Workflow. Design it for mobile first.
I claim a URL to use.
I add a control.
I change the name of the control.
I remove the control.
I add 5 more controls.
I launch my controller.
I read the instructions on integrating my controller.
I view my realtime logs.

Top bar:
Left: menu button, allows you to view your other controllers, get to documentation, etc.
Right: three bars, change into x on click and side panel slides out

Bottom bar?
Controls    Info     Logs

What are some fun interactions that could be added to make the experience of building this thing more fun? What are some things that could convey the potentiality that you have when you're building this stuff? What about adding web hooks?

Tonight: Storyboard an app with all the functionality of the web side. Figure out how to scale it up to the space available on ipad/desktop.

People are going to hit this page from a phone. If it's possible for them to build a controller on that device, they will. At the very least, they'll browse the controls. Asking them to claim a URL is an extremely low-cost way to get them into the thing. Although maybe claiming the URL up front is too much of a decision. Maybe I want to browse the controls first, because I don't know what I'm going to build until I know what tools I have available to build with. So maybe just link the "get hacking" button to the build page, let them build the controller first, and claim the URL at the end.

What are the pros and cons of requiring people to visit the site from a desktop? The most obvious con is that you can't build a controller from a mobile device. How big of a deal is that? A big enough deal that it needs to be included in an MVP? I think not.

Look at the squarespace UI - the controllers right now are overly simplistic and the entire interface looks a bit too much like a cheap imitation of window 8. What it really needs is a bit of understated professionalism. 

What about a 3-width bar (960px), with the "bottom bar" elements above? Your controller lives in the "build" screen, everything you need to integrate lives on the info screen, and all of your realtime logs live on the logs screen.

This screen is gonna need some color, though. I think that 3-panel box is a great idea, but all of the non-selected items are probably going to be some shade of gray - no pun intended. There really needs to be a good excuse to use a real subtle colored gradient here. Like a twitter blue. There
